# LIMOncello

Another tightly coupled LiDAR‑Inertial SLAM algorithm? Yep, based on the existing algorithms
[FAST-LIO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO), [LIMO-Velo](https://github.com/Huguet57/LIMO-Velo),
[Fast LIMO](https://github.com/fetty31/fast_LIMO) and
[DLIO](https://github.com/vectr-ucla/direct_lidar_inertial_odometry), but cleaner, faster, and
without [IKFoM](https://github.com/hku-mars/IKFoM)/[ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree)
dependencies.

LIMOncello is essentially FAST-LIO 2 with the Fast LIMO (and thus DLIO) implementation, but
without any dependency on the [IKFoM](https://github.com/hku-mars/IKFoM) or
[ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree) C++ libraries. It implements an Iterated Error
State Extended Kalman Filter (IESEKF) as described in IKFoM and FAST-LIO 2, reimplemented using
the [manif](https://github.com/artivis/manif) library and a refactored version of the original
[iOctree](https://github.com/zhujun3753/i-octree) data structure.

This is the result of my efforts to truly understand LIMO‑Velo and, consequently, FAST-LIO 2.
Those insights led to an improvement in performance and accuracy: LIMOncello is the first known
LIO‑SLAM system to incorporate the SGal(3) manifold in its state representation, and it uses
iOctree, which is much faster and more efficient than iKd-Tree. On top of that, the code is
portable, not as Fast LIMO, but as simplified as possible (the entire IKFoM library is
synthesized into `State.hpp` thanks to [manif](https://github.com/artivis/manif), for example)
so it’s accessible to anyone who wants to modify it.

## Dependencies

LIMOncello is header-only and the core depends only on:
- [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- [PCL 1.8](https://pointclouds.org/)
- [oneTBB](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB)

## TODOs

LIMOncello is still in progress, but the core is considered finished and working with ROS1.

- [ ] Stable ROS2 branch (`ros2/humble`)
- [ ] Test with LiVOX
- [ ] Test with Hesai
- [ ] Incorporate GPS correction
- [ ] Ground Speed Sensor correction or prediction
- [ ] Right‑Invariant EKF (imperfect)
- [ ] Iterated Right‑Invariant EKF (imperfect)

## Approach

To truly understand the concepts, here are the papers that greatly influenced this work, apart
from Fast LIMO:
- [IKFoM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03804)
- [FAST-LIO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08196) and [FAST-LIO2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06829)
- [Quaternion kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02508)
- [A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01537)
- [Absolute humanoid localization and mapping based on IMU Lie group and fiducial markers]
  (https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/206456)
- [iOctree](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08315)

The most important differences between these approaches and LIMOncello are that the latter does
not implement the S2 manifold and does not include extrinsics as part of the state (they remain
fixed). Nonetheless, LIMOncello was originally designed for Formula Student race cars and has not
yet been tested on KITTI or other common benchmarks.

I should also mention [S-FAST_LIO](https://github.com/zlwang7/S-FAST_LIO), which helped me grasp
the initial intuition behind the math of IKFoM, and [manif](https://github.com/artivis/manif),
which provides accessible, elegant Lie algebra tools for nearly any manifold used in robotics.
